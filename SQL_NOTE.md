mgr_id int,
mgr_startDate DATE,
Foreign key (mgr_id) REFERENCES employee(emp_id) ON DELETE SET NULL

**Functions**

Find the number of employees
```bash
select count(emp_id)
from employee
```
Find the number of female employees
```bash
select count(emp_id)
from employee
where sex= 'F'
```
Find the average of all employees salary

Used to defining patterns to match specific requirements.

from employee
where client_name like '%LLC'
```
Find any employee born in october
```bash
select *
from employee 
where birth_date like '____-10%';
// _ represents in one character
```
**UNION**

Combine results from multiple select statements

Find the list of employee names and branch name
```bash
select first_Name
from employee
UNION
select branch_name
from branch
```
**JOIN**

Joins are used to Combine rows from different tables based on a retaled column and useful for combining information from different tables into one single table.

**Inner Join**

Combine only employee id equal to manager id

(shared columns are common)

```bash
select 
from employee
join branch
on employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id
```

**Left Join**

All of the employess table include in the results and but only the rows in the branch table that matched. (branch table is the right table)

```bash
select
from employee
left join branch
on employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id
```
**Right Join**

All the rows from branch included in the final result. 

select
from employee
right join branch
on employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id

**Outer Join**

All of the rows from employee table and all rows from branch table include in the final result.

```bash
select 
from employee
outer join branch
on employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id
```

**Nested Queries**

Find all employees who have who have sold over 30000 to a single client

```bash
select employee.first_Name , employee.last_Name
from employee
where employee.emp_id IN (
         select works_with.emp_id
         from works_with
         where works_with.total > 30000;
        );

```

Find all clinets who are handled by the branch that Micheal Scott manages

```bash
// find the Branch id which handles by 


select client.client_id
from client
where client.branch_id IN (
   
           select branch.branch_id
           from branch
            where branch.mgr_id = (
            select employee.emp_id
            from employee 
             where employee.first_Name = 'Micheal' AND employee.   last_Name='Scott'
)
)

```
**ON DELETE**
1. On delete cascade

when manager is deleted in the table and associate table (Branch) , mgr_id set to null. 

```bash
Foreign key (mgr_id) REFERENCES employee (emp_id) on delete set NUll

```

Which means if the employee id from the employeetable gets deleted , set the branch mgr_id as NULL. 


2. On delete cascade (use when Foreign key is part of the primary key) 

If delete branch 2 , all of the rows that have branch id in this table would be deleted. 

**Triggers**

Triggers are basically a block of code which can define a certain action should happen .
```bash
craete trigger myTrigger Before insert
on Employee
for each row begin
insert into myTrigger values ("Added new employee");

```
